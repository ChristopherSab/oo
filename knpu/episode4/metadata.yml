title:  "OOP (course 4): Static methods, Namespaces, Exceptions & Traits! Woh!"
summary: |
    Finally, we can really *unload* and see all the *cool* OOP stuff
    that we haven't covered yet. These are the last missing pieces that
    are standing between you and understanding any OO code you meet.

    * Static methods
    * Class constants
    * Namespaces
    * Autoloading (RIP `require` statements)
    * `__toString` & the other magic functions
    * Treat that `$object[1]` like an array (`ArrayAccess`)
    * Throwing and catching ~~a baseball~~ Exceptions
    * Traits! Horizontal code re-use
    * Composition Versus Inheritance: Dressing your classes for success

    Finally, you're going to start to see some *serious* pay-off from
    these new, crazy OO skills you've got. In this tutorial, OO is here
    to impress *us*. Dig in.
