title:  "OOP (ep 3): Inheritance, Traits, Interfaces and other amazing things"
summary: |
    Things are about to get crazy.

    You've learned the basics ([Episode 1](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/oo)).
    Heck, you even mastered service objects, model objects and service containers
    in [Episode 2](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/oo-ep2)!

    Now we're getting into the meat of OO:

    * Class inheritance!
    * What is an interface? How can I leverage them?
    * What about abstract classes?
    * Introducing the "protected" visibility
    * Traits for code-reuse!

    This stuff will start to separate you from a beginner OO developer to someone
    who can really understand and flex OO code. It's hard stuff. So let's get started.
