# Extends

Welcome back for Episode 3 of our Object Oriented Series! We're ready
to get serious about Inheritance. I'm talking about extending classes,
abstract classes, interfaces, stuff that really makes object oriented
code nice but doesn't always look easy at first.

Don't worry this will all start to feel really familiar in a really 
small amount of time!

I'm already in the project that we've been working on through this series.
If you don't have this yet download the code and use what's in the 'start'
directory.

In a terminal I've also started the built in web server with `php -S localhost:8000`.
Be careful to do that in the start directory of the project.

So far in our project we have just this one lonely ship object. We query things
from the database and we load this ship object. But exciting things are happening
and we have a new problem! We want to model two different types of ships. We have
normal ships and since those are kinda boring we also now want rebel ships!

In the browser you can see we have two rebel ships in here coming from the database.
